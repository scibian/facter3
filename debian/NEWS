facter (3.10.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  This is a major upgrade from the 2.x series with many breaking changes.

  Facter has been rewritten in C++ and the old Ruby implementation has been
  removed. Facter still provides a Ruby API for custom facts, however much of
  the old Ruby API is no longer available. As a result, custom facts may have
  to be modified to work with the current Ruby API.

  Furthermore some rarely-used facts have been removed, potentially breaking
  Puppet manifests that use them.

  Please check the release notes at

    https://docs.puppet.com/facter/3.0/release_notes.html

  and all subsequent release notes for a detailed account of breaking changes.

facter (1.5.8-1) experimental; urgency=low

  When upgrading facter from 1.5.1 (the version in "lenny") or any previous
  version, a running puppet instance will stop working due to API changes in
  facter. If you have a running puppetd instance, it must be restarted.
